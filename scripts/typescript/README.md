# TikTokLive TypeScript Declarations

A potential use-case for TikTokLive is to create a web server that forwards events from Python to your front-end TypeScript application. 

In this case, type definitions for TikTokLive events are useful. After all, what's the point of a strictly typed language without types?

This module generates typedefs for TikTokLive to put into your project.

See the [package](package) folder for the NPM package `@TikTokLive/types`.
